__Sometimes executing a program can be a more expedient way to understand an
aspect of its functionality than reading its source code. Devise a testing
procedure or framework to examine how programs behave on write errors on their
standard output. Try it on a number of character-based Java and C programs (such
as the command-line version of your compiler) and report your results.__

I don't know how to solve this one.
